# Recommendation Engines


## 1. Introduction: 
Recommendations are being used to recommend everything from movies to music to friends to new destinations. There are three main methods for implementing recommendations that you will become familiar with throughout this lesson:

- Knowledge Based Recommendations
- Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendations
- Content Based Recommendations

After completing this lesson, we will be ready for the upcoming lessons where you will

- Learn about more advanced techniques.
- Deploy your recommendations in a web application.

These three lessons will aim to be extremely practical. The lessons will require that you write code to implement a number of different recommendation techniques


### Example Recommendations
- **LinkedIn and Facebook**

    Both LinkedIn and Facebook have recommendations for connections (business of friends) similar to what is shown below.
- **AirBnB Experiences and Destinations**

    AirBnB uses recommendations to determine experiences and destinations for their users.

## Types of Recommendations
In this lesson, you will be working with the MovieTweetings data to apply each of the three methods of recommendations:

   1. Model Based Collaborative Filtering
   2. Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering
3. Content Based Recommendations
